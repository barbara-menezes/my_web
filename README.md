Virtual Machines Administration

The project consists of setting up two virtual machines:

* a Dual Boot Archlinux and Debian client machine, which should be set up with the help of only ony
virtual machine named my-client_${name} (${name} corresponds to your name).
You are free to define the size of this machine’s random-access memory and virtual hard drive.
This virtual machine’s network interface controller will be configured in “Bridged”.
The system administrator has given us technical characteristics for each operating system that you
must comply with (see below).
* a server machine composed of a Ubuntu Server operating system.
The virtual machine should be named my-web_${name} (${name} corresponds to your name).
You are free to define the size of this machine’s random-access memory and virtual hard drive.
This virtual machine’s network interface controller will be configured in “Bridged””.
This second virtual machine will contain a Web server and therefore, should not have a graphic en-
vironment
